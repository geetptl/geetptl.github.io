This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It probably isn't necessary to use the artillary equivalent of front-end development for static HTML, CSS and some JS, but if you have stumbled so far, then you already know that I am a backend developer, and this is not a display of my excellent front-end skills. What it is, it is my web-resume, that I have managed to make work after spending ungodly hours. But hey, all is well that ends well! It is currently hosted on netlify. Take a look here!
